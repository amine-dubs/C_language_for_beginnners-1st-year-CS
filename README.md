# c_language_for_beginnners ASD
Hello,

Mohamed Amine BELLATRECHE a CS (informatique ingénieur / مهندس اعلام آلي) student at USTO,

I gathered some of the C language programmes that we coded in Asd (Algorithms and static/dynamic data structures) to help next year's students,

This is especially for ING and even for MI (1ere anner ofc)(beginners in general).

You're free to contribute:)

Salam.
