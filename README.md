# c_language_for_beginnners
Hello,

Mohamed Amine BELLATRECHE a CS (informatique ingénieur / مهندس اعلام آلي) student at USTO,

I gathered some of the C language programmes that we coded in in Asd (Algorithms and static data structures) to help next year's students,

This is especially for ING and even for MI (1ere anner ofc).

You're free to contribute:)

Salam.
